# Getting Oriented

As prescribed by Swire and the Capstone coordinators (Jeff, David), this directory is empty. To recreate our work, please follow the following steps to setup the directory for executing code.


## Desanitized Data

The `/original` directory is where we recommend putting the desanitized version of the four original files delivered to us as part of the capstone project. Those include:

* `customer_address_and_zip_mapping.csv`
* `customer_profile.csv`
* `delivery_cost_data.xlsx`
* `transactional_data.csv`

Provided the structure, data types, etc, are in the same format as was given to this group at the onset of the project, all files should execute as expected.

**NOTE:** Please also install the necessary libraries we used. That list and subsequent installation code can be found in the original repository `README.md`.
