```{r}
library('tidyverse')

swire_full <- readRDS('data/derived/swire_data_full.Rds')
customer_neighbor_fields <- read.csv('data/derived/customer_neighbor_fields.csv') |>
    mutate(customer_number = as.character(customer_number))
```


## Aggregate to a customer level of detail

The idea is take the full, cleaned customer data, along with neighbor fields from the modeling phase, to reproduce a cluster level of detail (i.e. 1 row = 1 customer).

```{r}
swire_cust_grp <-
    swire_full |>
    group_by(
        pick(customer_number:lon, return_frequency, year)  # Dynamically select grouping vars from a range and specific columns
    ) |>
    summarise(
        order_transactions = sum(ifelse(ordered_total > 0, 1, 0)),  # Count orders with any volume
        order_transaction_std = sd(ordered_total),  # Standard deviation of order volumes
        delivery_transactions = sum(ifelse(delivered_total > 0, 1, 0)),  # Count deliveries with any volume
        across(
            ordered_cases:delivered_total, 
            ~ sum(.x)  # Sum volume fields across all grouped records
        )
    ) |>
    ungroup()
```

```{r}
swire_cust_uniq <- 
    swire_cust_grp |>
    pivot_wider(
        id_cols = c(customer_number:primary_group_number, on_boarding_date:lon),  # Keep customer and location details as IDs
        names_from = year,  # Create wide columns based on year
        values_from = c(primary_group_customers, return_frequency:delivered_total),  # Use these variables as values
        names_glue = "{.value}_{year}",  # Name columns with value + year suffix
        values_fill = 0  # Fill missing values with 0 for all widened fields
    )

swire_cust_clean <- 
    swire_cust_uniq |>
    replace_na(list(
        order_transaction_std_2023 = mean(swire_cust_uniq$order_transaction_std_2023, na.rm = TRUE),  # Replace NA with column mean
        order_transaction_std_2024 = mean(swire_cust_uniq$order_transaction_std_2024, na.rm = TRUE), 
        delivered_gallons_cost_2023 = 0,  # Explicitly set NA cost fields to 0
        delivered_gallons_cost_2024 = 0, 
        delivered_cases_cost_2023 = 0,
        delivered_cases_cost_2024 = 0
    )) |>
    select(-c(city, zip, state_abbr, county))  # Remove unneeded location granularity
```


```{r}
swire_cust_enriched <- 
    swire_cust_clean |>
    inner_join(customer_neighbor_fields) |>  # Join with neighbor feature set
    mutate(
        across(c(on_boarding_date, first_delivery_date), as.Date),  # Ensure proper date format
        across(c(customer_number, primary_group_number), as.character),  # Convert IDs to character
        across(c(co2_customer, local_market_partner), as.integer),  # Convert logicals to integers for modeling
        customer_tenure_yrs = round(as.integer(lubridate::ymd("2024-12-31") - first_delivery_date) / 365.25, 1),  # Tenure as of end of 2024
        ramp_up_mon = round(as.integer(first_delivery_date - on_boarding_date) * 12 / 365.25, 1),  # Months between onboarding and first delivery
        annual_total = (ordered_total_2023 + ordered_total_2024) / 2,  # 2-year average of total ordered
        avg_transaction_amt = ifelse(
            (order_transactions_2023 + order_transactions_2024) <= 0, 0,  # Avoid division by 0
            (ordered_total_2023 + ordered_total_2024) / (order_transactions_2023 + order_transactions_2024)  # Avg order size
        ), 
        avg_neighbor_transaction_amt = (neighbor_avg_ordered_total_2023 + neighbor_avg_ordered_total_2024) / 
                                       (neighbor_avg_order_transactions_2023 + neighbor_avg_order_transactions_2024)  # Peer group avg
    ) |>
    select(-c(on_boarding_date, first_delivery_date))  # Drop raw dates now that derived fields are created
```


## Derive Segmentation

With that complete, we're ready to implement the logic for segmentation between RED and WHITE TRUCK.

```{r}
swire_segmentation <- 
    swire_cust_enriched |>
    mutate(
        # CRITERIA
        # Automatically white truck
        avoid = (
            trade_channel %in% c("SPECIALIZED GOODS", "PROFESSIONAL SERVICES", "VEHICLE CARE", "MOBILE RETAIL", "OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES") 
            & avg_transaction_amt < 9
        ), 
        # Automatically red truck
        fairly_new = customer_tenure_yrs <= 1, 
        # "Growth conducive customer profiles"
        big_box = (
            trade_channel %in% c("SUPERSTORE", "BULK TRADE", "GENERAL RETAILER") 
            & frequent_order_type %in% c("EDI", "SALES REP")
        ),
        niche_outlets = (
            trade_channel %in% c("RECREATION", "TRAVEL") 
            & frequent_order_type %in% c("SALES REP", "EDI", "MYCOKE LEGACY")
        ), 
        convenience_staples  = (
            trade_channel %in% c("FAST CASUAL DINING", "GENERAL") 
            & frequent_order_type %in% c("EDI", "MYCODE LEGACY", "SALES REP", "OTHER")), 
        # "Growth condusive markets"
        avg_tx_amt_flag = avg_transaction_amt >= 25, 
        larger_neighbors_flag = avg_neighbor_transaction_amt >= 25, 

        # SEGMENTATION LOGIC
        segment = case_when(
            avoid ~ "WHITE TRUCK", 
            fairly_new ~ "RED TRUCK", 
            ((big_box + niche_outlets + convenience_staples) > 0 
            | (avg_tx_amt_flag + larger_neighbors_flag)) > 0 ~ "RED TRUCK", 
            TRUE ~ "WHITE TRUCK"
        )
    )

```

In the above, we derive RED TRUCK customers via two lenses:

1. Growth conducive markets (customers or their average neighbors need 25+ average transaction amounts)
2. Growth conducive customer profiles (combination of characteristics that align with RED TRUCK material)

Customers have to either be in a growth conducive market or fit into at least one of the above profiles.
